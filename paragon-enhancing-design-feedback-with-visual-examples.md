*Paragon: An Online Gallery for Enhancing Design Feedback with Visual Examples*
Hyeonsu B. Kang, Gabriel Amoako, Neil Sengupta, Steven P. Dow

# Questions I had before reading the paper
* How might examples help novices provide design feedback? What about experts?
* When given examples, how do novices incorporate examples into their feedbacks? How do they help/hurt? What are the trade-offs?
* How do feedback providers choose examples? What are their exploration strategies?
* What are the limitations of example uses for novices?

# Takeaways
* Examples make the design feedback more specific, actionable and novel. 
* Usage pattern:
  * Use the examples to better explain certain points in the feedback.
  * For novices, examples reveal design concepts (which may correspond to some expert-created rubrics).
* Novice feedback providers tend to leverage examples with similar content to the target artifact due to lack of design knowledge. (Not a problem per se, but important to keep in mind when design a tool to supports this process).
* Finding appropriate examples takes time. Paragon allows feedback providers to filter examples based on some low-level and high-level attributes but we need more support evidence for the effectiveness of the tool.

# Notes
* Examples can help both feedback providers and receivers. This paper focuses mostly on the providers' side.
* The whole-process challenges:
  * How to curate examples?
  * How do feedback providers find relevant examples?
  * How do feedback providers integrate examples to their feedback?
  * How do feedback recipients apply the feedback to improve their work?
* Novices generally comprehend surface-level features.
* Faceted metadata and query preview helps with visual gallery exploration.
* Study 1: How feedback provider uses examples
  * Within-subject study
  * 
    
* Study 2: Examples' effect on feedback quality
  * Between-subject study
  *

# Questions coming out?
* How do attributes (quantity, diversity, quality, similarity to the subject under evaluation) of an example sets affect the quality of generated feedback? 
* Are example-based feedback positive or negative?
* How do the results generalize beyond the visual design domain? How does it apply to writing, music composition, etc.?
* What are possible strategies in example curation and selection? How might we design a tool to support them? How might an intelligent system help people find appropriate examples?
* How might feedback recipients make use of examples that integrated into the feedback?

# Questions / Applications for B12
* How might B12 customers integrate examples in their feedback on algo-generated websites? B12 has an unstructured way for the customers to do that (a list of websites that a customer likes and text description). However, these requires some work from the customers who might not know much about web design. Could we curate an example website gallery that the customers can explore?
* There will be difference between customer-to-designer feedback and designer-to-designer feedback.
* Can designers also use examples in explaining concepts to the customers?

# A Data-Driven Analysis of Workersâ€™ Earnings on Amazon Mechanical Turk
[Paper link](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/pubs/pdfs/2018/crowd-earnings.pdf)

# Main Takeaways
* The authors looked at traces from 2676 workers across 3.8M HITs (tasks) over a period of slightly more than 2 years (Set 2014-Jan 2017). The traces were from a Chrome plugin that workers used to track their hourly pay rate, etc.
* Average hourly pay was $3.13/hr, and the median was $1.77/hr. 4% of workers earn >= $7.25/hr (USA minimum wage).
* The authors quantify various forms of unpaid work, including looking for new tasks, starting but not completing tasks, and having their work rejected. If you remove this unpaid work, the mean goes to $6.19/hr, and the median goes to $3.18/hr.
* Interestingly, the average requester is paying $11.58/hr. A small number of requesters bring the average/median down with large quantities of low-paying tasks.

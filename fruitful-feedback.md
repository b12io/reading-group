# Fruitful Feedback: Positive Affective Language and Source Anonymity Improve Critique Reception and Work Outcomes
[Paper link](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2998319)

# Main Takeaways
* Feedback is most effective when it contains positive affective language and comes from an anonymous source.
* Feedback from a source with more perceived expertise (by the recipient) results in better work outcomes. Recipients associate positive affective language with greater source expertise.
* Feedback without positive affective language is received negatively and creates more work while degrading work outcomes.

# Questions Going In
* What is the perceived “power status” of an anonymous feedback source?
* Does positive feedback reception lead to better work outcomes?
* How will the authors evaluate work quality? Will the tasks be very different from our tasks at B12?

# Notes
* Conducted a 2x3 factorial between-subjects experiment
    * Independent variables: with/without positive affective language and peer/authority/anonymous source identity
    * Dependent variables: participants’ self-efficacy and self-identification as a writer
    * MTurk submits writing task -> receives feedback based on experimental condition -> submits revised article -> completes survey
    * Measured participants’ emotions, perception of feedback, perception of feedback source, number of changes, and article quality before and after
* Positive-affective language led to better feedback reception and work outcomes
    * Less negative and more positive emotions, a higher perception of the source, made less edits, and improved quality of work
    * The opposite was true for the without condition
*  Source anonymity led to better feedback reception
    * Participants were least annoyed/frustrated and thought feedback was most useful in anonymous condition
    * Requesters were considered fairer than peers
    * Most thought anonymous sources were requesters
    * No difference in quality or number of edits
* When requester source used positive-affective language, less edits were made
* No correlation between number of edits and improvement of quality

# Questions Coming Out
* How can this be combined with rubrics to create super-effective feedback?
* Does the tone of the actual critiques also effect feedback perception? (e.g. “Good work so far! The piece is boring…” vs. “Good work so far! The piece could use more enthusiasm…”)
* Can too much positive-affective language degrade outcomes?
* Is power status as significant as perceived expertise in different types of relationships?
* What about negative-affective language? Some feedback statements can come across as pretty harsh, does that affect quality/perceptions of workers?

# Questions for B12
* How do our design experts perceive the expertise of our design reviewers?
* How do our design experts perceive the feedback of our customers? Many customers approach us because they do not necessarily have expertise in web design.
* Can we improve how we communicate customer/reviewer feedback to design experts with positive-affective language and/or anonymity?
* The paper mentioned github as an important platform for online feedback. What can we learn about how we do code review from this paper?

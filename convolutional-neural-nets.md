## Adam questions
* I'd like to understand depth more. Is it just stacking all of the different filters together?
* What's the relationship between depth and interconnectedness? Do you only pool per filter, rather than along filter boundaries?
* Are filters that different from features in traditional ML?
* What is the difference between stride and pooling? Both seem to shrink the image. (Reading farther down in [Getting rid of pooling](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/), the authors make a similar suggestion.
* I didn't get any of the fully-connected/conv layer conversion stuff.
* Not a question, but this was heartening: `Instead of rolling your own architecture for a problem, you should look at whatever architecture currently works best on ImageNet, download a pretrained model and finetune it on your data`

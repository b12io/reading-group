# Reading
Fellow B12er [Daniela Retelny](http://danielaretelny.com/)'s final chapter of her thesis is on [Flash Organizations](http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2017/flashorgs/flash-orgs-chi-2017.pdf). We read her and her collaborators' CHI paper on the topic.

# Questions I have going in
* How much structure comes from the initial scaffold laid down by the person forming the organization, and how much comes from forks/teams?
* How much fluidity in membership does this model see vs. traditional organizations and vs. Flash Teams?
* How does promotion work? Is there a notion of demotion?
* What does a branch/merge conflict look like in a running organization?

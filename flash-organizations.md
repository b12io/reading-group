Fellow B12er [Daniela Retelny](http://danielaretelny.com/)'s final chapter of her thesis is on [Flash Organizations](http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2017/flashorgs/flash-orgs-chi-2017.pdf). We read her and her collaborators' CHI paper on the topic.

# Questions I have going in
* How much structure comes from the initial scaffold laid down by the person forming the organization, and how much comes from forks/teams?
* How much fluidity in membership does this model see vs. traditional organizations and vs. Flash Teams?
* How does promotion work? Is there a notion of demotion? What does it look like when the task you are working on gets "refactored?"
* What does a branch/merge conflict look like in a running organization?
* How does leadership/expertise come into play? A Tech Lead leads a team of engineers, but does Foundry help in determining who the Tech Lead should be?
* How much did each of the Flash Organizations cost in terms of human labor? How would this compare to hiring a small agency to solve the problem?

# 3 Takeaways
* Flash Organizations are role-based (e.g., movie crews) rather than asset-specific (i.e., requiring Jane on a particular team) to facilitate fast hiring based on skills/roles.
* Organizational change (hierarchical structure, roles, new tasks, task changes) can be proposed by anyone like a Pull Request on GitHub, and are reviewed by the leader of the team that the submitter is on. Reviewed changes/branches can be merged into the master organization, which results in new hiring, etc.
* In three applications (an EMS Android app, an actually manufactured/crowdfunded card game, an enterprise workshop web application), a leader used Flash Organizations to accomplish their goal satisfactorily in six weeks!

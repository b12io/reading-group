# 3 Takeaways
(marcua rough notes)
* Design rubrics help everyone
* Help novices more than experts
* Experts still provide better justification

# Questions I have going in

# Overall notes

# Questions I have coming out

# Questions for B12 to ponder
* We should provide rubrics to our design reviewers
* We should provide rubrics to our customers
* Our designer-powered recommendations are a form of design critique as well. What can we learn from that?
* CrowdCrit provides feedback with visual annotations---until we have that, how will our results be different?
* Can we open our dataset to one of these researchers?
